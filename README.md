## What's new (2025-11)

This repository was refreshed with a modern UI and small interactive features:

- Light / Dark theme toggle (state persists in localStorage).
- Smooth internal link scrolling and an improved responsive header.
- Clickable portfolio cards open a lightweight project modal with details.
- Contact form includes a demo send flow (replace with your backend endpoint).

Images and a favicon are included in `assets/images` and the root `favicon.svg`.

A placeholder resume was added at `assets/resume-placeholder.txt` so the site provides a downloadable CV link; replace it with your actual `assets/resume.pdf` to enable a true PDF download.

### Deploying to Vercel

This site is a static HTML/CSS/JS portfolio and can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration. A minimal `vercel.json` is included to enable clean URLs.

Quick steps:

1. Install the Vercel CLI (optional):

```powershell
npm i -g vercel
```

2. From the project root, run the deploy command and follow prompts:

```powershell
vercel
```

3. To deploy to production:

```powershell
vercel --prod
```

If you prefer not to use the CLI, you can connect this GitHub repo to Vercel via the Vercel dashboard and it will deploy automatically on push.
